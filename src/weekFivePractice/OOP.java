public class OOP {
	/*
	 * four main pillars:
	 * 	1) Abstraction: abstract class cannot be instantiated so must be instantiated by the classes that inherit
	 * 					same concepts are moved to higher level class
	 *  2) Encapsulation: keeping things under the hood
	 *  3) Inheritance: avoid duplicate code using superclass
	 *  4) Polymorphism: each class that inherits can implement in their own way
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  extends from parent class
	 *  @Override - tells that its coming from a super class
	 *  super means parent class - constructor from class you are inheriting from
	 *  
	 *  organize: fields then constructor then methods
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  EXCEPTIONS:
	 *  errors that keep code from compiling but aren't red
	 *  same as out of bounds exception
	 *  cause a program to crash unless the exception is handled
	 *  two types: checked and unchecked
	 *  checked: 	explicitly check for in the code, don't have control over it, so we can check for them
	 *  			use a try catch block to handle check exceptions
	 *  			most specific to most general in multiple catches
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  unchecked: we don't check for this, and write clean code and best practices: we have control over these
