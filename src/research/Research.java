		 * 1) https://stackify.com/oops-concepts-in-java/
		 * 		There are four main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. They are Abstraction,
		 * 		Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. Abstraction is using simple things to 
		 * 		represent hard things. In Java that means that something relatively simple like a 
		 * 		class can represent a harder more complex concept. Encapsulation is keeping some of 
		 * 		information within a class private so they aren't open to the public to be altered.
		 * 		Inheritance means we can create new classes and then use instances of them without
		 * 		having to recreate that code. Polymorphism means that we can have different meanings
		 * 		or uses of something when its used in a separate context.
		 * 
		 * 2) https://searchmicroservices.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP
		 * 		This article is a little more high level but talks about how object oriented programming
		 * 		is focused on the objects and their properties (data) and how to use them. We manipulate 
		 * 		the objects rather than the logic. The first step is to identify all the objects needed and 
		 * 		identify their relationships. This will also identify the data and logic each object needs. 
		 * 		Using classes allow you to identify subclasses that inherit concepts from the parent class.
		 * 		Dividing it this way also allows you to hide data and methods that aren't needed publicly.
		 * 
		 * 3) https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/J3a_OOPBasics.html
		 * 		This article focuses on creating reusable components. Creating classes and methods inside
		 * 		classes allows you to create a reusable component rather than recoding the same or similar
		 * 		logic whenever you need that same kind of action. You can create an object with its own 
		 * 		methods and data that allows you to model programs on real life behavior and concepts.
		 * 
		 * 4) https://javatutorial.net/java-oop
		 * 		Everything in Java is an object. The main idea behind OOP is to represent data and logic as
		 * 		objects instead of actions or functions and includes 4 main principles: 
		 * 		Encapsulation: wrapping variables and methods in a single unit to hide them from external 
		 * 		classes.
		 * 		Inheritance: Allows Java classes to use concepts and function from other Java classes.
		 * 		Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details from the user but providing them the functionality.
		 * 		Polymorphism: Allows subclasses to define their own unique behaviors while still sharing
		 * 		some functionality from the parent class.
		 * 
		 * 5) https://www.w3resource.com/java-tutorial/java-object-oriented-programming.php
		 * 		Writing object oreint programs involves creating classes, creating objects from those classes, and
		 * 		creating applications which are stand alone executable programs that use those objects. A class
		 * 		is considered a blue print that defines information about the object. An object is an instance
		 * 		or example of the class. You can have many different instances of the same class. This article
		 * 		also discusses the main concepts of OOP in Java.
		 * 
		 * Differences between checked and unchecked exceptions:
		 * 	An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event that disrupts the flow of a program's instructions.
		 * 	Checked exceptions are checked at compile time so they are easy to handle ahead of time with
		 * 	try/catch blocks or some type of exception handling. If you address these possibilities in your code
		 *  you can have your code handle the exception and your program can keep running. Unchecked exceptions
		 *  are not checked at compile time and don't need to be caught explicitly. These are usually due to 
		 *  programming errors. These generally do not reduce code readability. The general idea is "if a client 
		 *  or program can be expected to recover from an exception, make it a checked exception. If it cannot 
		 *  recover, make it an unchecked exception." Both of these exceptions help to ensure the application's
		 *  normal flow.
